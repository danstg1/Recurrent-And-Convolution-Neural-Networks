# Recurrent-And-Convolution-Neural-Networks
Description: An artifical intelligence that uses both convolution and neural networks in conjunction with Tensor Flow. Completed by following the course provided by Aurélien Géron in their book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow
This is also where all the other neural network projects I have worked on is pushed to.
